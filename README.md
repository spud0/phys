# Physics Engine #

in C++, SDL and some other goodies

# Plan #
	-  refactor using namespaces and a few template classes (rough ideas)
		- math namespace (vector)
		- phys (constants and other physic's formula's)
		- view (renderer)
		- shape (template specializations for different shapes (`SDL_Rect` etc) 
	
	- use catch2 for testing
